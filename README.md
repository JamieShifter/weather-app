# WEATHER-APP ALPHA

In this project, we will build a weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API(?). The app will allow users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions for that city.

Here's what you need to do to get started:

1. brew postgres (brew install postgresql@15)
2. clone this repo to your local machine
3. install ruby, check version
4. install rails, check version
5. setup postgres(create user, create database, etc)
6. bundle install
6. rails server --binding=127.0.0.1
7. visit localhost:3000
